🛡️ Why I Chose to Study Cybersecurity (Beginner's Perspective)

> 🔒 "To outsmart a hacker, you need to think like one."



That quote hit me hard the first time I read it during the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, and it hasn’t left my mind since.

🧠 Curiosity Turned into a Career Path

I didn’t come from a deep tech background or start hacking computers at age 10.
What I did have was curiosity — about how systems work, how attacks happen, and how defenders respond under pressure.

When I realized that cybersecurity isn’t just about coding — it’s about protecting people, I knew I wanted to be part of it.

🛠️ What I’ve Been Doing So Far

I’m not just watching videos or reading articles.
I’ve been building real skills and proof:

🧾 Earned the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

💻 Set up a full home lab with Kali Linux, Metasploitable, and Wireshark

🧪 Captured real DNS traffic using tcpdump and analyzed it in Wireshark

🧱 Completed recon phase of the Mr. Robot CTF on TryHackMe

🐍 Started building cybersecurity scripts in Python

📂 Publishing my labs and writeups on GitHub


Every task I do gets turned into a public project — so I’m not just learning, I’m documenting it.

🎯 My Goal: Become a Cybersecurity Analyst

I want to work in a Security Operations Center (SOC), help detect real threats, and keep systems safe from attackers.
I love how analytical, fast-paced, and always-changing this field is.

📘 If You're Also Starting Out...

Don’t worry about what you don’t know.
Start with what you can learn, build projects, and be consistent.

Even simple labs like:

DNS captures

Port scanning with Nmap

Writing one script


…can take you a long way if you share them and reflect on what you learned.

✅ Final Thought

Cybersecurity is more than a job — it’s a mission.
And I'm proud to be taking my first real steps toward it.
